# Mac-CSE-Info-Hub

Welcome to the Mac-CSE-Info-Hub! This is an open-source, informal guide crafted especially for McMaster University's CSE students. Dive into a pool of shared experiences, tips, and invaluable insights that go beyond the official handbook.

## Why this guide?

While the official handbooks offer a structured and formal approach to academic procedures, there's a wealth of student knowledge that remains untapped. This guide aims to bridge that gap, providing a platform where students can share, learn, and help their peers.

## How to Use

Navigate through the various sections of the guide to explore topics ranging from course experiences to research opportunities, funding details, and more. Each section provides a blend of official information and student-contributed insights.
