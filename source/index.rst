Welcome to McMaster CSE Student Info Hub!
=========================================================
Welcome, fellow Marauders! This unofficial guide aims to supplement the formal CSE Student Handbook by providing a collaborative and dynamic platform where you can get insights, tips, and shared structured experiences. Whether you're new to the department or a seasoned student, we hope this guide serves as a valuable resource throughout your journey at McMaster's CSE.

Our aim is to keep this guide open, informal, and continuously evolving. If you have insights or experiences that can benefit others, feel free to contribute by opening pull request on our Github!
